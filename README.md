[suckless](https://suckless.org/) software with pre-applied patches, custom keybindings etc.

> Note : I am not the author of dwn, dmenu or any other suckless software.

## Simple Terminal

[Simple terminal](https://st.suckless.org/), otherwise known as *st* is the terminal emulator of my choice. I have 2 patches installed :
* [Gruvbox](https://st.suckless.org/patches/gruvbox/) colorscheme, to go with my neovim setup.
* [Newterm](https://st.suckless.org/patches/newterm/), which allows spawning a new terminal using ```Ctrl+Shift+Return``` in the same CWD as the original st instance.
* [Scrollback](https://st.suckless.org/patches/scrollback/) Scroll back through terminal output using ```Shift+PageUp/PageDown```.

## Dynamic Window Manager
[ Dynamic window manager](https://dwm.suckless.org/), otherwise known as *dwm* is my go to window manager with following patches applied :
* [underlinetags](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/underlinetags/) to highlight current tag/workspace.
* [actualfullscreen](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/actualfullscreen/) to fullscreen apps.
* [alwayscenter](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/alwayscenter/) to center floating apps.
* [layoutscroll](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/layoutscroll/) to cycle through all layouts.
* [pertag](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/pertag/) to preserve layout of each tag/workspace.
* [warp](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/warp/) to warp the mouse cursor to the center of the currently focused window/screen.
* [scratchpad](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/scratchpad/) to spawn or restore a floating terminal window.
* And my favorite window layouts, [three-column](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/three-column/) and [horizgrid](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/horizgrid/).
